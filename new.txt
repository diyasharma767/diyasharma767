Number data types store numeric values. Number objects are created when 
you assign a value to them.
Python supports four different numerical types :
 int (signed integers)
 long (long integers, they can also be represented in octal and
 hexadecimal)
 float (floating point real values)
 complex (complex numbers)
7.What are python strings?
Strings in Python are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in 
the quotation marks. Python allows for either pairs of single or double quotes. Subsets of 
strings can be taken using the slice operator ([ ] and [:] ) with indexes starting at 0 in the 
beginning of the string and working their way from -1 at the end.
The plus (+) sign is the string concatenation operator and the asterisk (*) is the 
repetition operator.
str = 'Hello World!'
print str[0] # Prints first character of
the string o/p:
